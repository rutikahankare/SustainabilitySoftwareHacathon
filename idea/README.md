As data is the new revolution and everyday millions of data is stored by every organization it is enssential to store the data compredded and optamise it whenever required.
The data stored in the data center can be optamised to reduce enrgy consumption and reduce the carbon–footprint created by the software development sector.

To Solve the issue creating an API for developer and cloud interface to tackle the compatability issue and cloud optimization to reduce the use of energy in data base .
Limited functionality: Some software solutions may offer limited functionality or may not address all of the areas that need optimization. It's important to evaluate the specific needs of the cloud server and choose a solution that offers comprehensive optimization capabilities.
Sharing improvement plans for compatibility before the software is created and then create a software to tackle the compatibility issue .
Security concerns: Optimizing cloud server data can involve sensitive information, and it's important to choose a solution that offers robust security features to protect against data breaches or unauthorized access.
Cloud already provides various security solutions 
Lack of customization: Some software solutions may offer limited customization options, which can limit their effectiveness in optimizing cloud server data for specific use cases or configurations. It's important to choose a solution that offers customization options to meet the specific needs of the cloud server.
We can customize the API using which type of data is to be compressed and then delete the redundant data as per the administrator commands ,which is not available in the software's available in the market

Present your solution, talk about methodology, architecture & scalability
This API will check for the compatability of the software and data set with the cloud enviornment and then compressing the data accordingly .

CDN (Content Delivery Network): A CDN is a network of servers that are distributed across different geographic locations. By using a CDN, you can store copies of frequently accessed data in multiple locations, which can improve performance and reduce the amount of time it takes to transfer data. This can also help reduce energy consumption by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the internet.
Checking which duplication software to use so that the redundant data can be deleted and Hashing: One of the most common methods of deduplication is to use hashing. In this approach, a hash function is applied to each piece of data in the dataset, and the resulting hash value is stored. When new data is added to the dataset, it is compared against the existing hash values. If a match is found, the data is considered redundant and is not stored.
Content-Defined Chunking: This method breaks the data into chunks of fixed size, called blocks, based on the content rather than a set block size. Each block is assigned a hash value, and duplicates are identified by matching the hash values.
Delta Encoding: In delta encoding, each piece of data is compared against the previous piece of data in the dataset. If the new data is similar to the previous data, only the differences between the two are stored. This can be useful for datasets that are updated frequently, as only the changes need to be stored.
Compression: Compression algorithms can be used to remove redundant data by compressing the dataset and identifying patterns that can be stored more efficiently.
Also checking the compression algorithms 
Zstandard API: Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm that provides high compression ratios while still maintaining fast compression and decompression speeds. The Zstandard API can be used to integrate Zstandard compression into a database or other storage system, allowing data to be stored more efficiently and with less energy consumption.
Snappy API: Snappy is a compression algorithm that is optimized for speed and is commonly used for compressing data that is transmitted over a network. The Snappy API can be used to integrate Snappy compression into a database or other storage system, allowing data to be stored more efficiently and with less energy consumption.
LZ4 API: LZ4 is a compression algorithm that provides fast compression and decompression speeds while still achieving good compression ratios. The LZ4 API can be used to integrate LZ4 compression into a database or other storage system, allowing data to be stored more efficiently and with less energy consumption.
Brotli API: Brotli is a newer compression algorithm that was developed by Google and is designed to provide high compression ratios while still maintaining fast compression and decompression speeds. The Brotli API can be used to integrate Brotli compression into a database or other storage system, allowing data to be stored more efficiently and with less energy consumption.
